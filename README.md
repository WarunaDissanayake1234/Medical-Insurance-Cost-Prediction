# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction with Logistic Regression

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts medical insurance costs using Logistic Regression.

## Overview

This project implements a Logistic Regression model to predict medical insurance costs. Python programming language was used for implementation, and Google Colab served as the development environment.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the code)
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WarunaDissanayake1234/Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload the provided notebook to Google Colab.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess the data, implement Logistic Regression, and predict medical insurance costs.
